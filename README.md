### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Srinidhi945/AI_Research_Q_and_A
    cd AI_Research
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    This creates an isolated environment for your project's dependencies.

      * **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

      * **On macOS & Linux:**

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Create a file named **`.env`** in the root of your project folder. This file will securely hold your secret API key. Add your key to it as shown below:

    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
    ```

    > **Note**: You can get your free API key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

5.  **Run the Application**
    Start the Flask development server.

    ```bash
    python app.py
